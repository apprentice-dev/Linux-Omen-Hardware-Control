# Linux Omen Hardware ConTroL (LOCTL)

Linux Omen Hardware ConTroL (LOCTL) will be a linux kernel module that completely reimplements Omen Gaming Hub functions (keyboard light rgbs, animations, performance control, undervolting) etc. on linux, preferrably arch linux because it is my trusty and most preferred OS. Imagine not having to boot into Winblow anymore to change bios settings, and having complete control over vendor-specific functionalities without having to play with winbloat XD's rules, how cool!
